Class Repository

Lecture notes are published here:

https://uwpce-pythoncert-classrepos.github.io/Python310-Fall-2020

(or you can read the "restructured text" (rst) files directly in this repo)

This repository is used for notes, examples, and solutions for the
Fall 2020 online section of University of Washington Continuing and Professional
Education Python Certificate program.

https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming

I recommend that you clone this repository and put a copy on your computer. Then, as we add more examples, solutions, etc as the class progresses, you can do a `git pull` and always get teh latest version.


Structure of the Repo
=====================

The class repo has three top level directories:

* `examples`: Used to store example code and example documents for the class.

* `solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises.

* `notes`: These are notes used for each class session

test code for the "trigrams" exercise

NOTE: This is NOT a complete set of tests! You will want to add more of

As you develop your code, if you are about to add a feature, or think
of an edge case:

    Write a new test for that first!

Also note that you may want to do some different things with processing
the text -- if so, then update the tests (and add more) to reflect how you want your code to work.

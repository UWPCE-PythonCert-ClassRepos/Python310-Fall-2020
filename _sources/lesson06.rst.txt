mailroom 4!!!!

**WTF?**

What if I haven't gotten version 2 done yet???


Issues that came up during the week.
====================================

looping through a dict
----------------------

If you need just the keys::

    for k in a_dict:
       ...

If you need just the values::

    for v in a_dict.values():
       ...

If you need both::

    for k, v in a_dict.items():
       ...


dict as switch -- how do you leave the loop?
--------------------------------------------

Let's look at a particularly nifty solution:

``solutions/Lesson05/mailroom_dict_as_switch``


quit()
------

In my solution to mailroom, I created a function called ``quit`` to quit the program. That is not a great idea, as there is a built-in called ``quit``.  In my defense, the ``quit()`` built-in didn't exist when I learned Python :-).


``readlines()`` ?
-----------------

Quite a few of you have code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        full_lines = f.readlines()

    for line in full_lines:
        ...

Nothing wrong with that, but ...

``.readlines()``  reads the entire contents of the file into memory all at once.  Memory is big and cheap these days, but what if it's a REALLY big file?

If you are going to process the file line by line anyway, you might as well do:

.. code-block:: python

    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            ...

That will loop though the file line by line, but only store one line at a time in memory.  The file system and disk should have a smart cache, so that it will be just as fast, but more memory efficient.

And one less line of code :-)

Binary vs text files
--------------------

``open()`` uses text mode (deafult encoding -- utf-8?) by default. It will try to decode the file into text. If you open a binary file that way it will likely barf.

::

open(the_filename, 'rb'

Is the way to open a binary file (note the "b") -- this weill read the bytes in the file, with no alteration.

For more on what "decode" means:

Any Questions about the homework -- or anything?
------------------------------------------------

review trigrams?

review mailroom?


Break and Lightning talks
=========================


Testing?
--------

Did y'all do the testing exercise with a coding bat example?

We could do one now.

Or...


Advanced Argument Passing
-------------------------

All this ``*arg``, ``**kwargs`` stuff a bit confusing?

Let's explore it a bit.

AND -- we'll use TDD to do it.

Exercise in the class notes here:
